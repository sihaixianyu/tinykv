# TP 201 of PingCap talent plan

>In general, this is a entry-level project for rust beginners. The originator provide some tests to evaluate the correctness of your code for `KvStore` and `kvs`.

## 1. Knowledge

- `cargo`: Official build tool for compling, runing and tests rust code, it also provides package management out of box.
- `clippy`: Linter for rust code.
- `rustfmt`: Formatter for rust code.
- `clap`: A Popular third-party library for command generation in rust ecosystem. It provides builder-style and struct-style to generate command line tools easily.

## 2. Modifications

- Reorganize test functions in `tests/tests.rs` with mod `store_tests` and mod `cmd_tests`.
- Finish basic function of `KvStore`, replace relevant test functions with appropriate assertions.
- Finish basic function of `kvs`, replace relevant test functions with appropriate assertions.
